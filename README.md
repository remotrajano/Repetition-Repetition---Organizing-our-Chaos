# Repetition-Repetition---Organizing-our-Chaos
This is the place for everything. Don't be shy. Vomit what's inside yourself, doesn't matter how.

You write about a man who's about to commit suicide and realise how hard to find death, maybe i'd want to start the opposite side, writing about the same man but he's dead and he's trying to backtrack through his pieces of memory to understand how he died.

You can't be at peace until you understand why you had to die, and the story would be a sort of purgatory of clubbing souls going backwards through a giant maze of broken memories.
