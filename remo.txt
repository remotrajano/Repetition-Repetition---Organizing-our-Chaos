I NEED SPINOZA
PROP. LXVII. A free man thinks of death least of all things; and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.
PROP. LXIV. The knowledge of evil is an inadequate knowledge.

FUCK EVIL
Corollary.—Hence it follows that, if the human mind possessed only adequate ideas, it would form no conception of evil.
So Evil comes from the world, not I
oups, that was highly ambiguous: Is it that I do not come from the world, or that the Evil doesn't come from me?
or both?
or neither?

In logic, a three-valued logic (also trinary logic, trivalent, ternary, or trilean,[citation needed] sometimes abbreviated 3VL) is any of several many-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating true, false and some indeterminate third value.

i have no idea how to explain it better : I looked for myself too much, then I almost died for a fucking eternity (once for one night and then a second time for three real life days and nights)
but only good hashish sir i swear
i read too much books, and books you read too much then you can never throw up, you're gonna swallow them or they end up swallowing you right?
you try to read too much of everything and then reading everything becomes too much for one time, too much for one space
too much for one brain maybe because i just saturated of too much everything, even if i swear i only went for everything good
but too much good too much time and it's no good anymore haha
14 August
Hubert Naïm
maybe too many people is the problem
because too many places and too many people and too many stories you never have any time writing stuff down and everything becomes too much too quickly
i played with words and with speaking too much, i played the neo nihil prophet too much, and in french it rhymes with fiesta too much
prophet == pro-fête
and i didn't have any berlin fiesta or any good techno dancing vibe for too long
buuuut all in all, I feel gooooood today
i listened to nicolas jaar all night and now i feel like every space is music again

fuck man
i think i just re wrote your whole story backwards
you write about a man who's about to commit suicide and realise how hard to find death, maybe i'd want to start the opposite side, writing about the same man but he's dead and he's trying to backtrack through his pieces of memory to understand how he died
you can't be at peace until you understand why you had to die, and the story would be a sort of purgatory of sould going backwards throw a giant maze of broken memories
purgatory of souls*

of clubbing souls
you go backwards through your recorded dialogues the same way the character would be running through the maze of his life
25 August at 12:04

imagine if you could go back to your recorded conversations, come back to them in dream and at some point you decide to interrupt the normal flow of memory, you try to go back and imagine WHAT IF i had said something else? what if i had asked this fucking question i had in mind at the time, that is still haunting me now? what if i had decided i didn't want to be the person i was anymore? You'd come back to one specific situation and you choose to behave the exact opposite of what your normal self of the time would have behaved.

when you say you need structure to build the game, you mean the story structure right? Yes, I think we have to find the subjects of each game at first, like i said in the mail, I wanna find it with you

yeh i think structure means rules for the games
25 August at 12:28
Remo Trajano
and about the story of the man who is dead trying to understand how he got there is pretty nice, let's save it, maybe we can use it in the story itself, maybe another character he meets up, or himself at certain point, I don't know but I like it (maybe a second book? haha)
25 August at 12:29 · Sent from Web
Hubert Naïm
but i'm thinking about a next layer of rules, in the sense that we can't play only one game with a single unchanging set of rules
we need to play all the games, we need to play the game of inventing new rules for the game
so maybe what i mean when i say structure you could translate into "meta-rules": the rules for how to make rules
25 August at 12:31

apart: art in greek is techne
Friday at 02:14 · Sent from Web
Remo Trajano
The most common and significant caveat made regarding the saying is that "art" (Latin: ars, translating Ancient Greek: τέχνη (techne)) originally meant "technique, craft" (as in The Art of War), not "fine art". Hippocrates was a physician who made this the opening statement in a medical text. The lines which follow: "The physician must not only be prepared to do what is right himself, but also to make the patient, the attendants, and externals cooperate." Thus in plainer language "it takes a long time to acquire and perfect one's expertise (in, say, medicine) and one has but a short time in which to do it".[3] It can be interpreted as "art lasts forever, but artists die and are forgotten"[3] (in this use sometimes rendered in the Greek order as "Life is short, Art eternal"), but most commonly it refers to how time limits our accomplishments in life.

but in computer science, when you get to study the idea of complexity, you look at the notions of time and space applied to algorithms, how long does the algorithm take to terminate? how much space does it need to compute, i.e. how much memory does it use?

it's super hot in paris at the moment, and it's been three days of intense procrastination

i realised that the first thing I needed to do was finish the game we began this all with
i mean, i need to answer to your email and try n explain what the fuck happened to me and why i had to end at a psychiatric hospital instead of being in berlin
i'm thinking i could try and plan it as a theater play as well
Yesterday at 21:38
Hubert Naïm
the first act would be me living the first two weeks of my first ramadan, two weeks where all i talk about with every person i meet is systematically religion
actually it's more three months of talking about religion
three months of introspection living a simple life at the terasse of cafés smoking beautiful hashish, three months of reading spinoza and trying to fit the idea of God that I read about in his first chapter, and the idea of God that is in everyone's mouth in morocco
Yesterday at 21:42
Hubert Naïm
i spent three months trying to speak moroccan arabic just by chatting shit with people in the streets, where in every expression you hear : insh'allah means "if god wills" but you use every time you talk about tomorrow, hamd'oullah means "thank god" but you use it every time you talk about yesterday, allah wakbar you have to hear at least five times a day
Yesterday at 21:43
Hubert Naïm
during the three months I go through Spinoza's five chapters : I read about God first, then about the Mind, about Desire and about Control
the fifth chapter and conclusion of the Ethics is on "The Power of the Intelliect - aka Human Freedom"
Yesterday at 22:20
Hubert Naïm
the idea is that the whole book is a living mathematical proof : Spinoza is proving that by reading through his book and following the proofs one by one, you can set yourself free from prejudices, you can free your mind from the bad patterns of thoughts and access to a state he simply calls "happiness"
Yesterday at 22:22
Hubert Naïm
in brief : the Ethics tempts at a being a mathematical proof for the existence of happiness
and i would say i went pretty deep into the proof, and i can sort of become a living proof that the book proves what it pretends to prove : i am indeed a happy man, and i think those three months set me free of a lot of things, at least in theory
by the end of this introspection, the end of the introduction, I began my roadtrip around morocco
and i need to explain the roadtrip to explain what happened that prevented me from going to berlin
Yesterday at 22:25
Hubert Naïm
and i needed to explain how i prepared myself for the roadtrip : 3 months of solitary life exploring casablanca, two weeks of ramadan that had started turning my whole mind upside down, and I was now getting to the end of my notebook where I had notes of Spinoza's Ethics, Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus, Kundera's slowness among other stuff, but also notes of me trying to keep traces of my fleeting everyday life of discovering town

HTML narratives[edit]
In contemporary society webpages or to be more correct, hypertext, have become affluent forms of narratives. Hypertexts have great potential to create non-linear forms of narratives. They allow for individuals to navigated within the story through links, images, audio and video. An established hypertext narrative is Public Secret.[15] Public Secret illustrates the reality of being incarcerated in California's Criminal Justice System. It brings to light the way inmates are treated. This functions as a non-linear narrative because it allows for its audience to witness through text and audio the reality of being a female inmate. However, there is no exact beginning or end as there are in comic books or video games. This website consists of multiple subtopics that do not force the audience to make their next selection based on what their previous experiences are.

How To Save Facebook Chat Messages?
I want to save my chats with a friend WHOLE - meaning, all the text PLUS the emoticons used, PLUS the time and date of the chats. Is this possible? If it is, how do I do it?

I DON'T want to use the "Print Screen" command and paste to the Paint program as a jpg file - that, I already know how to do. I want to save the chat messages with a friend in a normal file, like Microsoft Word, for example, where I can touch up the messages, for example, correcting minor spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, but basically still preserving all the words, PLUS importantly, the emoticons used.
Just now
